Chef webui in PHP (with Laravel framework)
==========================================

What is it ?
------------

This is a project created just to have fun with Laravel and at the same time do something useful for me. The bundled web UI with the open source chef server makes it really difficult to do quick changes.

--------

* Databags listing and editing

Installation
------------

* Clone it
* Composer install
* Configure your knife key location in app/config/packages/jenssegers/config.php
* Use the buildin server (artisan serve) to test
* Have fun!

TODO
----

* Full CRUD for databags
* Add/Remove fields for databags
* Support array fields
* Basic node listing
* Editing of existing node attributes
